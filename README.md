# PowerCo Churn Prediction

## **Overview**

This repository contains the code for PowerCo's customer churn prediction project. As a major gas and electricity utility, PowerCo is facing challenges with customer retention in the competitive energy market. The primary goal is to understand and address customer churn, with a focus on evaluating the hypothesis that price sensitivity is a significant driver.

## **Key Objectives**

- Analyze customer data, churn data, and historical pricing data.
- Define and calculate price sensitivity.
- Engineer features and prepare the data for analysis.
- Build and test binary classification models (Random Forest Classifier).
- Evaluate model performance based on complexity, explainability, and accuracy.
- Extrapolate the impact of price sensitivity on customer churn.
  
## **Hypothesis**
  
The central hypothesis is that Price Sensitivity is the primary influencer of customer churn. The analysis aims to quantify the extent to which price sensitivity contributes to customer attrition.
